# automated-MSN-synthesis
Documentation and example code for forthcoming automated mesoporous silica nanoparticle synthesis paper


Contents to include in documentation:
- Examplar notebook to run entire synthesis including AFL loading
- 3D prints for labware
- Digital syringe tools used here (or do these go in the science-jubilee repo? probably)
- Purchasing links for consumables used in synthesis (vials, caps, septa)
- Step by step guide to setup including loading vials, setting offsets, loading stocks, and running synthesis
- Link to separate sample loading system documentation
